Managing App Location with React Router
	- Rendering UI with JS in a single page application
	- How do we get links to specific 'pages' inside the app?!?!?

Two ways pages can load
	- Browser goes to server and says, "Give me all the contents for this page"
	- Page loads and AJAX gets the rest of the content as it's needed

Things to keep in mind when thinking about Router
	- is this page book markable?  Can I share this interesting state w/someone else and have them see that same state?
	- does this page link around like I expect a page to link around (back, forward, open in new tab, etc)

Dynamically render pages
